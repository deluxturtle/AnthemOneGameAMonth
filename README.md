# AnthemOneGameAMonth
For the one game a month jam. Going with a tile based turnbased strategy + go?

### Retrospection
This project went pretty well for a jam. 
- You can load new levels from Tiled as XML which is pretty cool.
- Menu's have some polish
- Has 1 completed level to demo pathfinding and turn based movement. 

Not a complete game but a greate place to start building a 2d turn-based little game.
